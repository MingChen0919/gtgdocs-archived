## Install R package **gtgr**

**gtgr** is available from GitHub. We can use the `devtools::install_github()` function to install R packages from GitHub.

First, we need to install the **devtools** package.

```{r}
install.packages('devtools')
```

Now install **gtgr**

```{r}
devtools::install_github('mingchen0919/gtgr')
```


## Launch a GTG instance

After successfully installing the **gtgr** package, we can launch a GTG platform with the `start_new_gtg()` function.
You need to specify a GTG working directory. All output files will be in this directory.

```{r}
library(gtgr)
start_new_gtg(gtg_directory = '~/Desktop/gtg-dir', gtg_name = 'gtg')
```

This will open a GTG platform on your browser.

## Launch a Galaxy instance

Some functionalities of the GTG platform depends on a running Docker Galaxy. We can launch a Galaxy instance with `launch_galaxy()`. You need to specify a GTG instance name so that the Galaxy instance can be connected with it. Here we use 'gtg', which is what we used in the previous step. Currently, **gtg** is only compatible with the Galaxy Docker image created by [Björn Grüning](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable)

```{r}
launch_galaxy(gtg_name = 'gtg')
```

This will open a Galaxy instance on your browser.

To list all GTGs and Galaxy instances, use the `list_gtg()`:

```{r}
list_gtg()
```

This is basically the same as running a command line `docker ps -a` from within a terminal.

```{r eval=FALSE}
  CONTAINER ID                         IMAGE                COMMAND           CREATED           STATUS                                   PORTS  NAMES
1 a53d3a6cbb88 bgruening/galaxy-stable:17.01              "startup" About an hour ago Up About an hour 21/tcp, 443/tcp, 8800/tcp, 9002/tcp, 80 galaxy
2 e3300efb9cdc        mingchen0919/gtgdocker "/entrypoint.sh /bin…" About an hour ago Up About an hour                                    8080    gtg
```


To see a list of all availabl functions from package **gtgr**.

```{r}
help(packaeg = 'gtgr')
```


## GTG working directory

The GTG working directory has three folders. The **galaxy_tool_repository** will contain all files generated from the GTG platform. And this is the tool repository directory that you want to publish to Galaxy Tool Shed (or Test Tool Shed). The **database/** and **shed_tools/** are two directories that mount to **/export/galaxy-central/database/** and **/shed_tools/** from [Björn Grüning]'s Galaxy Docker container.

```{r eval=FALSE}
.
├── database/
├── galaxy_tool_repository/
└── shed_tools/
```

GTG has a user interface which allows you to map the **galaxy_tool_repository/** to a existing tool repository within the **/shed_tools/**. Therefore, you can easily test the tool developed with GTG on your running Galaxy instance. It also allows you to map an updated tool shed repository back to the **galaxy_tool_repository/** so that you can publish the updates to Galaxy Tool Shed (or Test Tool Shed).

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/get-started/images/mirror-tool-repository.png')
```
