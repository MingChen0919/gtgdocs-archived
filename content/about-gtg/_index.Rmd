## GTG components

**The GTG platform consists of three components**:

* [two Drupal modules](https://github.com/MingChen0919/gtgdocs/tree/master/gtg_modules): **galaxy_tool_generator** and **galaxy_tool_generator_ui**.
    + the **galaxy_tool_generator** module maps each [Galaxy tool config](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/schema.html) XML elements to a drupal webform components. The "Type" column in the figure table below is an example of showing the mapping between XML elements and webform components.
    + the **galaxy_tool_generator_ui** module builds user interfaces
    
    ```{r}
    knitr::include_graphics('/about-gtg/images/tool-xml-mapping.png')
    ```
    
* [**gtgdocker**](https://github.com/MingChen0919/gtgdocker): a docker image that wraps a drupal site with the two GTG modules installed.

* [**gtgr**](https://github.com/MingChen0919/gtgr): an R package that launches, stops and deletes the GTG platform.

## Requirements

The GTG platform runs as a Docker container and is controled by the R package **gtgr**. Therefore, [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) and [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) are required.
