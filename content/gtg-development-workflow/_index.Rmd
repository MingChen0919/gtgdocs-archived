## Galaxy tool repository and its status

A Galaxy tool repository consists of one or more [Galaxy tool XML files](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/schema.html), and usually some non-XML files such as scripts and test datasets.

When using the GTG system to develop Galaxy tools, a Galaxy tool repository can be at different statuses according to its location:

1. **Tool Repository in GTG**
2. **Tool Repository in Galaxy Test Tool Shed**
3. **Tool Repository in associated Galaxy instance**
4. **Tool Repository in Galaxy Tool Shed**


### Tool Repository in GTG

We start Galaxy tool development by first creating some XML files in GTG. We then group these XML files and build a Galaxy tool repository from them. We can optionally add non-XML files into the tool repository. Then we publish the tool repository from GTG to the **TEST Tool Shed**. At this stage, it's fine even if we don't have a fully function tool repository. But it's important to have the **requirements section** of each XML files well defined, since the requirements section defines tool dependencies which are required for the tool testing step.
