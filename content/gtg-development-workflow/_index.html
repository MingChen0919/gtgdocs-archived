<h2>Galaxy tool repository and its status</h2>
<p>A Galaxy tool repository consists of one or more <a href="https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/schema.html">Galaxy tool XML files</a>, and usually some non-XML files such as scripts and test datasets.</p>
<p>When using the GTG system to develop Galaxy tools, a Galaxy tool repository can be at different statuses according to its location:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Tool Repository in GTG</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tool Repository in Galaxy Test Tool Shed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tool Repository in associated Galaxy instance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tool Repository in Galaxy Tool Shed</strong></li>
</ol>
<div id="tool-repository-in-gtg" class="section level3">
<h3>Tool Repository in GTG</h3>
<p>We start Galaxy tool development by first creating some XML files in GTG. We then group these XML files and build a Galaxy tool repository from them. We can optionally add non-XML files into the tool repository. Then we publish the tool repository from GTG to the <strong>TEST Tool Shed</strong>. At this stage, it’s fine even if we don’t have a fully function tool repository. But it’s important to have the <strong>requirements section</strong> of each XML files well defined, since the requirements section defines tool dependencies which are required for the tool testing step.</p>
